# OOP_Bowling

A Bowling Game Designed in OOP Java Style

Decided to get some physical practice with object oriented programming and decided to create me a bowling game.

This is the first stages of it.

I got the basics working.

Hopefully, I will have it finished soon.

Version 3:  Created a way to track score and transfer data to data.  Class to class.

Version 2:  Created another class to calculate values for the second frame and played around with arrays to help pass values.

Version 1:  Initial creation of main and class to a frame.

Thanks for looking!
